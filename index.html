             Child labour is the employment of children in activities that deprive them of their childhood, potential, and dignity, often harming their physical and mental development. This includes hazardous work, child slavery, forced labour, and exploitative domestic work. The prevalence of child labour is driven by various factors, and it has significant adverse effects on the affected children and society.

                    Poverty is a primary driver of child labour, as families often rely on the additional income from their children to survive. Lack of access to education, cultural factors, economic demands for cheap labour, and weak legal frameworks further perpetuate this issue. These underlying causes create a complex environment where child labour thrives, especially in developing regions.

             The consequences of child labour are severe. Children working in hazardous conditions face serious health risks, including injuries and chronic illnesses. Missing out on education limits their future opportunities, trapping them in a cycle of poverty. Moreover, the psychological impact of exploitation can cause long-term mental health issues. Societally, the dependence on child labour hinders economic development by reducing the skilled workforce needed for future growth.

                International conventions like ILO Conventions No. 138 and 182 set standards for minimum employment age and the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. National laws, aligned with these standards, and global initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eradicate child labour. Organizations like UNICEF and movements like the Global March Against Child Labour play crucial roles in these efforts, focusing on education, economic support, legal enforcement, and awareness campaigns.

            <p class="question">
            In a lot of countries such as India, China, and a lot of countries in Africa, children are left to work all day without getting a proper education for them to be successful later on in their lives. 

            In a country such as India where a lot of the population is in poverty, children are told by their parents that they should work hours a day just to be able to provide a living for their families.

        <strong>2. What articles of the UDHR are being violated?</strong>

            <p class="question">
                Article 1 Equality 
            </p>
            <p class="question">

                Child Labour takes away young children’s right to opportunities to grow as a human in a safe environment but also takes away the needed childhood of a young child as well, which is important for children so that they don’t experience other sorts of trauma that children in child Labour are already experiencing. Having children in harsh work conditions compromises health and is simply not equally right compared to those children not being affected by child labour. With this existence of child labour, children instead of playing and being free, some are forced to work at a young age restricting their chance to develop freely. This way of economic gain simply doesn’t provide any sort of equality to those children vulnerable to this treatment.

    <p class="question">
                Article 26 Education 
    </p>
            <p class="question">
                Child Labour completely takes away the right for them to have an education or to have any sort of learning. Instead of attending school and learning to grow their future, children in less fortunate communities are forced to work long hours just to make ends meet and to provide for their families as both parents may not be able to afford their daily needs. These children instead of learning to read and write, are forced to go and work in dangerous conditions where they do tasks that could risk their health and safety.  

            </p>
            <p class="question">
                    <strong>3. How does this human rights issue affect the well-being of the people involved? </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="question">

                Children who are involved in child labour are affected by both their physical and mental well-being. Children who are exposed to work in dangerous conditions are highly likely to experience harsh casualties and injuries also since some of these children's bodies haven’t yet fully developed making them even more prone to injuries. In some conditions in which child labor happens, They may also be prone to toxins such as Asbestos, Pesticides, and Benzene if these children work in places like construction, agriculture, or gasoline industries.
            </p>
            <p class="question">

                Some of these children who are exposed to child labour don’t only get affected physically but also mentally as well. Children in child labour are more likely to experience things such as anxiety, low confidence, and emotional trauma because of child labour. This is because of the stressful work experiences that are put into making them more vulnerable to these mental well-being consequences. This effect on children is terrible for their future because these change their mood and other aspects of life. 

            </p>
            <p class="question">
                <strong>4. What social actions can individuals, groups, and institutions (governments/schools/businesses) take to raise awareness and take action to address this human rights issue?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                To address child labour, individuals, groups, and institutions can take various social actions. Schools and community organizations can raise awareness by educating the public on the consequences of child labour and advocating for children's rights. Governments can implement and enforce strict labour laws, ensuring that children are not exploited and that they have access to education. Businesses can commit to ethical practices, avoiding child labour in their supply chains and supporting fair trade initiatives. International organizations and NGOs can provide support and resources to affected communities, helping to lift families out of poverty and reduce the reliance on child labour.
            </p>
            <p class = "question">


                Laws, policies, and measures play a crucial role in eradicating child labour. Governments should enforce existing laws, such as minimum age requirements and safe working conditions, in alignment with international standards like the ILO conventions. Policies that promote access to quality education and provide economic support to families can reduce the financial pressures that lead to child labour. Strengthening social protection systems, such as healthcare and unemployment benefits, can also alleviate the conditions that perpetuate child labour. Additionally, international cooperation and partnerships can help monitor and combat child labour globally, ensuring consistent efforts across borders
